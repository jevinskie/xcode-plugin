  Xcode Plug-in Template

  A while back ago, Apple had packaged with the installs of Xcode a template for creating
  AppleScript plugins for Xcode. That has long past now and has been removed. This is a
  replacement that not only adds in a capability of creating new Xcode plugins but also
  creating them in Objective C instead of AppleScript.

  ====================================== INSTALLATION ====================================

  This template can be installed in 3 different locations
  
  /Developer/Library/Xcode/Project Templates/Application Plug-in
  /Library/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Project Templates/Application Plug-in
  ~/Library/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Project Templates/Application Plug-in
  
  The latter two locations will set the template to be a "User Template" whereas the
  first location is a developer-tools install specific location and will be accessable
  as if it were a tools installed template.
  
  Make sure to restart Xcode before attempting to create new targets with this template.
